# Project

## Introduction
I'm excited to present a project I undertook during the Summer of 2022, focusing on the implementation of advanced informed search algorithms for optimizing driving routes within a toy map of Romania. The primary objective was to determine the shortest path between two points while minimizing time and space costs. The project emphasized achieving efficient runtime performance and effective memory management.

## Key Highlights

### Priority Queue Optimization 
- Developed a custom priority queue with O(1) insertion and O(log n) removal time.
- Utilized the heapq library and maintained FIFO order for nodes with the same priority.

### Breadth-First Search 
- Implemented the breadth-first search algorithm for systematic graph traversal.
- Ensured exploration of neighbors in alphabetical order for consistent results.

### Uniform-Cost Search 
- Designed and implemented uniform-cost search, utilizing a priority queue for optimal path discovery.

### A* Search 
- Implemented A* search with a heuristic based on the Euclidean distance.

### Bidirectional Uniform-Cost Search 
- Developed bidirectional uniform-cost search to enhance search efficiency.
- Conducted parallel searches from both the start and end states to converge on the optimal path.

### Bidirectional A* Search 
- Implemented bidirectional A* search, incorporating heuristic estimates from both directions.
- Optimized pathfinding by considering heuristic estimates from both ends.

## Conclusion
This project is a testament to my proficiency in implementing and optimizing various informed search algorithms. By focusing on efficient runtime, memory management, and strategic search methodologies, I successfully tackled real-world challenges in route planning. The project reflects my strong skills in algorithm design, optimization, and creative problem-solving.
