# Project Overview
This project, undertaken during the Summer of 2023 as part of the CS 7280 course on Network Science, delves into the intriguing realm of epidemic modeling within complex networks. With a focus on practical experimentation and simulation, this assignment aims to bring theoretical concepts into real-world comparison.


## Outbreak Modeling 

Constructing an undirected graph from interaction data using NetworkX.
Simulating outbreaks using the SIS model with defined parameters.
Visualizing outbreak simulations and analyzing susceptible and infected counts over time.
Fitting exponential curves to initial outbreak growth and comparing to theoretical estimates.
Calculating theoretical time constants (ùúè) from various degree distributions and assessing the simulation results against theoretical values.
Evaluating and comparing theoretical and simulated endemic sizes. 
## Transmission Rate Analysis 

Varying transmission rates (beta) to observe their impact on infection spread.
Simulating multiple outbreaks for each transmission rate and averaging results.
Plotting beta-tau curves to visualize how different transmission rates affect outbreak dynamics.
Calculating minimum theoretical beta values for epidemic onset and comparing with simulated results.
Analyzing and interpreting the similarity between theoretical and experimental endemic sizes. 
## Patient-0 Centrality & ùúè 

Exploring the influence of initial infected node (patient-0) on outbreak spread.
Running simulations with different nodes as patient-0 and analyzing successful cases.
Calculating various centrality metrics (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector) for nodes.
Investigating correlations between centrality metrics and outbreak time constants (ùúè).
Visualizing scatter plots of centrality metrics against ùúè and assessing correlation strengths. 
## Knowledge Question 

Addressing a theoretical question related to submodularity of objective functions.
Throughout this project, I have engaged in data analysis, simulation, theoretical calculations, and visualization, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of network epidemic dynamics. By combining hands-on experimentation with rigorous theoretical exploration, I have gained valuable insights into the intricate interplay between network structures and disease spread. This project underscores my commitment to applying network science principles to real-world scenarios, thus contributing to both theoretical knowledge and practical applications.
