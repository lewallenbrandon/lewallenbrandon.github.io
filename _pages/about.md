Hello there! I'm Brandon and I'm a Software Engineer working for Emerson Electric. I'm also a Masters student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I have a very diverse background with skills and experiences across several disciplines, but now I exclusively focus on software development and artificial intelligence. Machine Learning, my preferred AI subtopic, has been an interest of mine for years and I love being able to take data about a subject and uncover interesting patterns. The experimental nature of Machine Learning is extremely fulfilling; there's a sort of intuitive nature that makes it challenging and rewarding. Something else I love is being able to intertwine my Software Engineering experience with it; this experience helps me write clean, reusable, code to apply to several experiments across many different problems. I love that as well. 

My Work Experience
======
Right now I work for Emerson Electric in their Process Systems Solutions department. I focus on application development for DeltaV, a distributed control system. Given the size and scope of DeltaV, I've had the great experience of being able to sample many different aspects of Software Engineering whether that be cybersecurity related features, to building pipelines, to implementing business logic, or fixing bugs. See my work experience section for more information on the projects I helped bring to life in DeltaV. 


My Education
======
Let me start off by saying what I am most proud about my education; I worked full time during all my of education. I have my B.S. in Computer Science from Western Governors University where I was exposed to your regular fare of CS subjects like Operating Systems and Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithms, Mathematics, and so on. 

I'm currently obtaining my M.S. in Computer Science with a heavy, heavy focus in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence 
Hello there, 

I am a Software Engineer who comes with a diverse background of skills and experience. While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I worked full time and this allowed me to grow my knowledge of computer science while also obtaining valuable professional skills. I have senior management experience leading six supervisors spanning 150 employees in a startup organization. I also have experience with human resources where I provided reporting and analytics support to finance, legal, and the C-suite for a Fortune 500 company. After I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science, I transitioned to a Software Engineer role in another Fortune 500 company. Here's a link to my work experience for more details.

I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science with a Machine Learning Specialization from Georgia Institute of Technology. I've completed the following courses: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Network Science, Machine Learning for Trading. I plan on taking: Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence Ethics, Graduate Algorithms, Big Data for Health, and Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Robotics. Check out my projects section for more information on what all I've worked on! 

My strongest skills and knowledge areas are: communication, leadership, software development, and machine learning. (Making coffee, but that comes with an extra cost.)

When it comes to programming languages, I consider Python to be my best language and I'm not going to sell myself short, I'm pretty knowledgeable and experienced in it. C# is my next best language, but I use this purely for my current role. I dabble in C++ and only use it when absolutely necessary. What can I say, the more abstract the language, the better.
