Hello there! I'm Brandon and I'm a Software Engineer working for Emerson Electric. I'm also a Masters student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I have a very diverse background with skills and experiences across several disciplines, but now I exclusively focus on software development and artificial intelligence. Machine Learning, my preferred AI subtopic, has been an interest of mine for years and I love being able to take data about a subject and uncover interesting patterns. The experimental nature of Machine Learning is extremely fulfilling; there's a sort of intuitive nature that makes it challenging and rewarding. Something else I love is being able to intertwine my Software Engineering experience with it; this experience helps me write clean, reusable, code to apply to several experiments across many different problems. I love that as well. 

My Work Experience
======
Right now I work for Emerson Electric in their Process Systems Solutions department. I focus on application development for DeltaV, a distributed control system. Given the size and scope of DeltaV, I've had the great experience of being able to sample many different aspects of Software Engineering whether that be cybersecurity related features, to building pipelines, to implementing business logic, or fixing bugs. See my work experience section for more information on the projects I helped bring to life in DeltaV. 


My Education
======
Let me start off by saying what I am most proud about my education; I worked full time during all my of education. I have my B.S. in Computer Science from Western Governors University where I was exposed to your regular fare of CS subjects.

I'm currently obtaining my M.S. in Computer Science with a heavy, heavy focus in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Georgia Tech's curriculum is known for its rigor and I can attest that it made me feel very confident in my understanding of this subject. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel very equipped to navigate the foggy unknown. 

Check out my education section of my CV for more information on the subjects I've taken. 


My Skills
======
As a Software Engineer, you get exposed to a myriad of technology tools. I'm sure you get it. So, I'll just tell you what I consider are my best skills and what I've honed in all my experience. I have leadership, management, and communication that came from my management roles. Software design, debugging, problem solving (one could say that problem solving is just a less cool way of saying debugging), and cost-benefit analysis that come from my Software Engineer role and education.
